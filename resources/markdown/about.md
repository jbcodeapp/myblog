Hi! I'm Benjamin Crozat. I'm from the South of France and **I've been a self-taught professional web developer for more than 10 years**.

Coming from a modest family, **being able to educate myself for free on the web changed my life for the better**. Giving back to the community was a natural direction in my career.

Therefore, I decided to take action to increase my reach:

1. I launched this blog in September 2022 with the goal to be in everyone's Google search. **I get more than 18,000 monthly clicks from it and more than 35,000 visits overall** ([my analytics dashboard is public](https://benjamincrozat.pirsch.io/?domain=benjamincrozat.com&interval=30d&scale=day) by the way).
2. I also started growing my [X (formerly Twitter)](https://x.com/benjamincrozat) account at the same time, which has now **over 4,200 followers**.
3. Then, Jeffrey Way took notice, reached out, and offered me to write for the [blog of Laracasts](https://blog.laracasts.com/posts/build-a-simple-online-store-using-laravel-folio-and-volt).

Believe me, I'm just getting started and many other cool things are on the way!
