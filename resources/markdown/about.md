Hi! I'm Benjamin Crozat. I'm from the South of France and **I've been a self-taught professional web developer for 12 years**. I started learning PHP and JavaScript back in 2006 when PHP 4 was still widely used, Internet Explorer 6 ruled the world, and we used DHTML to add falling snow on websites.

**Being able to educate myself for free on the web changed my life for the better**. Giving back to the community was a natural direction in my career and I truly enjoy it.

Therefore, I decided to take action:

1. I launched this blog in September 2022 with the goal to be in everyone's Google search. **I get more than 20,000 monthly clicks from it and more than 50,000 visits overall** ([my analytics dashboard is public](https://benjamincrozat.pirsch.io/?domain=benjamincrozat.com&interval=30d&scale=day) by the way).
2. I also started growing my [X (formerly Twitter)](https://x.com/benjamincrozat) account at the same time, which has now **over 4,700 followers**.
3. I'm almost working full-time on this blog; constantly writing new content and making it as valuable as possible.
4. To make sure I don't have to fall back into employment or working for clients, I reduced the cost of my life to the bare minimum.
5. All the content I write is free thanks [my sponsors](/#sponsors) (if you want to support my work, you can [promote your business](/media-kit)).

Believe me, I'm just getting started!
